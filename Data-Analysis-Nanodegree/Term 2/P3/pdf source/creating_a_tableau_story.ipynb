    "This story focuses on the dataset of loan information from Prosper, a peer-to-peer lending marketplace. In particular, the story exaimes how assets and liabilities affect the proprietary Prosper score, which measures the risk of the lending to the borrower, similar to the more widely used credit score.

    "When I set out to make my story, I prioritized the content of what I wanted to portray. In other words, my focus was on making graphs that showed the information I needed to make my points. I wasn't content with the sheet captions to convey the information, since it took a lot of scrolling in the narrow box, so I put the captions in floating text boxes on the sheets. To make the story look a little more polished, I stylized everything to a shade of blue, changing the text boxes and backgrounds to shades of blue to match the colors used in the graphics. \n",

    "Based on the feedback, I cleaned up some of the axis labels and added graph titles to all the graphs. I also added opening and closing slides. In reviewing the story myself, I decided to change all the worksheets in the story into dashboards so that I could add more elements per sheet and get rid of the floating text. I reorganized the presentation to put the caveat about the data aggregation at the end. I also changed some of the wording to make the sheets flow better and provide better explainations. I worked on stylizing the whole story and added general dataset overview visualizations as well as pictures on the opening sheet."
